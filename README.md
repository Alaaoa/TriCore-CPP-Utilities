ðŸ§© Overview

This project is a modular C++ utilities library built with three main reusable classes:

clsDate â€“ A complete date-handling and calendar utility.

clsString â€“ A flexible string manipulation toolkit.

clsUtil â€“ A collection of general-purpose helper functions for randomization, encryption, array manipulation, and more.

Together, these classes form a solid foundation for C++ learning, projects, and reusable software tools.
